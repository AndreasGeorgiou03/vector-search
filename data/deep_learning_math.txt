Mathematics of Deep Learning

Deep learning relies on linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

Neural networks use gradient descent to optimize loss functions.

Backpropagation computes partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to model parameters.

Regularization techniques such as L2 penalty help prevent overfitting in neural networks.
