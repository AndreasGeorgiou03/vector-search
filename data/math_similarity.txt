Mathematical Similarity and Distance

Cosine similarity is a measure used in geometry to calculate the angle between two vectors in Euclidean space.

In mathematics, vectors represent magnitude and direction. Cosine similarity is commonly used in linear algebra and physics.

Distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine distance are used to compare numerical vectors.

Unlike semantic embeddings, mathematical similarity does not involve natural language understanding.
