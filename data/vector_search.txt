Vector Search Systems

Vector search enables similarity search using high-dimensional embeddings.

Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.

FAISS is a library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search.

Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors and is commonly used in semantic search.

Hybrid search combines keyword-based retrieval with vector similarity search.
