Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling systems to learn patterns from data.

Supervised learning involves labeled data. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Unsupervised learning does not use labeled outputs. Clustering algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering are commonly used.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks. Convolutional neural networks are widely used for computer vision tasks.

Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data instead of generalizing. Techniques like regularization and dropout help prevent overfitting.
