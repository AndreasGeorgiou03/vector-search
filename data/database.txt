Database Systems

A database management system (DBMS) is software that allows users to store and retrieve structured data efficiently.

Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL is the primary query language used to interact with relational databases.

NoSQL databases include document stores, key-value stores, and graph databases. They are often used for scalable web applications.

Indexing improves query performance by allowing faster lookup of records.

ACID properties ensure reliable transactions in relational databases.
