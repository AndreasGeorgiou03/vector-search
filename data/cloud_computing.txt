Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtual machines and storage.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides development platforms without managing infrastructure.

Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure are major cloud providers.

Scalability and elasticity are key benefits of cloud systems.
