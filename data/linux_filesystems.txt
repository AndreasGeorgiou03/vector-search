Linux File Systems

Linux supports several file systems including ext4, XFS, and Btrfs.

The file system manages how data is stored and retrieved from disk.

Mount points allow file systems to be attached to the Linux directory tree.

File permissions and ownership determine who can read, write, or execute files.
