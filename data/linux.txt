Linux Operating System

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds.

The Linux kernel manages hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage.

Common Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

The command line interface (CLI) allows users to interact with the system using shell commands.

Package managers like apt and yum help install and manage software packages.
