Cloud Security Practices

Cloud security involves protecting data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud environments.

Encryption, identity management, and network segmentation are essential security mechanisms.

Cloud providers offer shared responsibility models where both the provider and customer manage security aspects.

Compliance standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2 are important in enterprise cloud deployments.
